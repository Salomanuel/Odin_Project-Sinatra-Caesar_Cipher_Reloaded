#Project 1: Caesar Cipher reloaded

Revisit the caesar cipher ruby script that you created during Ruby Building Blocks and use Sinatra to create a simple front-end for it.
##Your Task

1. Start a new sinatra project (you can begin by doing a simple hello world as in the Jumpstart tutorial, just to make sure everything is set up correctly)
2. You should be able to do this with only one view, and a couple of routes, but feel free to be as fancy as you like.
3. Deploy to Heroku!
